    "* Web scraping is a \"fragile\" approach for building a dataset. The HTML on a page you are scraping can **change at any time**, which may cause your scraper to stop working.\n",
    "* If you can **download the data** you need from a website, or if the website provides an **API with data access**, those approaches are preferable to scraping since they are easier to implement and less likely to break.\n",
    "* If you are **scraping a lot of pages** from the same website (in rapid succession), it's best to insert delays in your code so that you don't overwhelm the website with requests. If the website decides you are causing a problem, they can block your IP address (which may affect everyone in your building!)\n",
